/**
 * This class demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
 *
 * <p>It defines an Employee class that represents a basic employee with attributes such as
 * name, email, and salary. The Employee class adheres to SRP by encapsulating only the
 * properties and basic details of an employee.
 *
 * <p>Additionally, the class includes a SalaryCalculator class responsible for calculating
 * the pay of an employee. This separation of concerns ensures that the Employee class focuses
 * solely on representing an employee's data, while the SalaryCalculator class handles the
 * responsibility of computing salaries based on a predefined logic.
